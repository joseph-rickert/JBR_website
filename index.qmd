## A Brief Introduction

I am a broadly educated technology professional with executive level experience in several industries. With some notable exceptions, I have mostly worked at small companies and start-ups.(One which I co-founded was moderately successful.) I have held executive level positions in management, technical marketing and field sales. Additionally, I have done senior level technical work in mathematical model building, statistical analysis and data science.

### R Community Work

Since 2009 I have been active in the R Community and have held prominent positions in the R Consortium including Chair of the Board of Directors and Executive Director. (See Work Experience for details). I participate in a number of technical working groups associated with the R Consortium and the ASA Including the [R Submissions WG](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg), the [R Repositories WG](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg), [RTRS](https://github.com/RConsortium/rtrs-wg), the [Census WG](https://github.com/RConsortium/censusguide), the [R Validation Hub](https://www.pharmar.org/), and the [Openstatsware WG](https://www.openstatsware.org/people.html). For several years, I ran the R Consortium [RUGS program](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/r-user-group-support-program) that supports R user groups and small conferences worldwide. I have been a member of the [R/Medicine](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/) conference organizing committee since the fist conference in 2018. I was part of the organizing committee that hosted the [2016 useR! Conference](https://user2016.r-project.org/) at Stanford University and I have been an organizer of the Bay Area useR Group ([BARUG](https://www.meetup.com/r-users/)) since 2009.


### Technical Work

I maintain an active interest in practice of statistics with a focus on survival analysis, Markov processes, and functional data analysis. I have published a number of posts on the [R Views Blog](https://rviews.rstudio.com/) in these areas. I occasionally consult on technical projects assisting with statistical analysis, mathematical model building, and decision analysis. I have the experience to ask the relevant questions and the technical expertise to provide data-driven answers.
