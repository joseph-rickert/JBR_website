    "text": "Much of what we know about our world results from the work of inspired, unfunded scholars deeply committed to projects that most of us can only dream about. In late 1991, by chance, I learned that Berkeley Egyptologists Carol Redmount and Renee Friedman were having difficulty finding the funds to support their project to locate “Leontopolis” an ancient Egyptian city of some import, whose location had been lost.\nThis was a time of great excitement, before the internet, when the promise of personal computers was just reaching fields such as archaeology and PC manufacturers were competing with imaginative new uses for their mobile person computers. I guessed that the companies equipping their tablet computers with experimental handwriting recognition software would jump at chance to have their product figure in a story to look for a “lost city”. I wrote several proposals to the top tablet makers, all of them expressed an interest, however none came through with any funding.

In late 1991, by chance, I learned that Berkeley Egyptologists Carol Redmount and Renee Friedman were having difficulty finding the funds to support their project to locate “Leontopolis” an ancient Egyptian city of some import, whose location had been lost.\nThis was a time of great excitement, before the internet, when the promise of personal computers was just reaching fields such as archaeology and PC manufacturers were competing with imaginative new uses for their mobile person computers.
