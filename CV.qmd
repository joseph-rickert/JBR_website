For a time, the company was cultivated by [U.S. Venture Partners](https://www.usvp.com/) for some time. Under their guidance, the company incorporated, expanded the founding team to expand a more experience CEO, a CFO, a Chief Medical Officer, and began the process of applying for patents. In the end, USVP declined to fund, being unwilling to finance the process of securing medical billing codes that was believed to have been necessary. LifeSignals was twenty years too early.
